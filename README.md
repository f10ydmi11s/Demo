# Demo
Template for an online database administration web application using the MS SQL Northwind database. You can browse the demo at http://demo3.youarereasonable.com


Identification of the need:

There are certain tasks in software development that are rarely completed and implemented half-heartedly. Estimates are usually unreliable because work might take longer resulting in developers being put under pressure to complete. This resulting in low quality code. For example, every database web application needs to be maintained using the create, read, update and delete operations normally known as CRUD. This project uses a framework to quickly create a template for a secure online database administration web application that can be customized. This allows programmers to be creative by not tying them down to repetitive CRUD coding.

The solution:

This solution uses a framework that extracts details from the map of the database and generates the administration application. It is a semi-automated process where the database will be analysed manually using tools and experience to make sure the database complies to a standard object relationship layout. Once compliance is passed the generation process will start. There are three milestones to the solution.

1. The analysis of the database
2. The application generation
3. The delivery

The predicted results:

The results will be all the code and files necessary to further develop and run the application on your servers. The solution will deliver everything within days! Whereas, such a project can take months requiring an expert or experts to work more than 30 hours per week at an expensive rate. This benefits the organization because the quality of code is not lowered while programmers can concentrate on new features that benefit their customers.

Notes: This project uses the example MS SQL Northwind database. You can download the Northwind database scripts from its GitHub repository at https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/northwind-pubs
